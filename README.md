#My Public Transport Helper

This is a personal project that builds a little dashboard with the earliest public transport connections using raspberry pi and a touch LCD. The connections are scraped from idos.cz website for public transport in Prague. We hardcoded three destinations that are nearest to the point of interest (AndÄ›l). We use kivy for GUI.
